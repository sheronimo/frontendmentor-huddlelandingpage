## Overview

Hi! This is my attempt at the Huddle landing page with single introductory section solution.

For this challenge, I tried to time myself to see whether I could finish within a "logical" timeframe that a front-end developer would generally take for a component/page for this level. The solution was relatively straightforward, and I approached styling with an idea in mind to have everything closer to the middle of the page for a more "modern" UI component look, as opposed to the traditional "header stuck to the top and footer stuck to the bottom" webpage look.

## My process

1. I worked on dividing the markup first into a `header`, `main` and `footer` for semantic purposes.
2. I worked on styling the body and background.
3. I then styled each section individually before fine-tuning the spacing.
4. I then worked on the responsive styling and layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I primarily learned about how to treat a whole page as a Flex container and align each component individually.
